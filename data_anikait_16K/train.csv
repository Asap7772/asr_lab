data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0001.wav,"Author of the danger trail, Philip Steels, etc."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0002.wav,"Not at this particular case, Tom, apologized Whittemore."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0003.wav,For the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0004.wav,"Lord, but I'm glad to see you again, Phil."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0005.wav,Will we ever forget it.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0006.wav,"God bless 'em, I hope I'll go on seeing them forever."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0007.wav,And you always want to see it in the superlative degree.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0008.wav,"Gad, your letter came just in time."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0009.wav,"He turned sharply, and faced Gregson across the table."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0010.wav,I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0011.wav,If I ever needed a fighter in my life I need one now.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0012.wav,Gregson shoved back his chair and rose to his feet.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0013.wav,"He was a head shorter than his companion, of almost delicate physique."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0014.wav,"Now you're coming down to business, Phil, he exclaimed."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0015.wav,It's the aurora borealis.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0016.wav,"There's Fort Churchill, a rifle-shot beyond the ridge, asleep."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0017.wav,From that moment his friendship for Belize turns to hatred and jealousy.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0018.wav,There was a change now.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0019.wav,"I followed the line of the proposed railroad, looking for chances."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0020.wav,Clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0021.wav,It fairly clubbed me into recognizing it.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0022.wav,Hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0023.wav,A combination of Canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0024.wav,It was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0025.wav,I was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0026.wav,It occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0027.wav,To my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0029.wav,Their forces were already moving into the north country.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0030.wav,I had faith in them.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0031.wav,They were three hundred yards apart.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0032.wav,Since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0033.wav,"He unfolded a long typewritten letter, and handed it to Gregson."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0034.wav,Men of Selden's stamp don't stop at women and children.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0035.wav,"He stopped, and Philip nodded at the horrified question in his eyes."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0036.wav,She turned in at the hotel.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0037.wav,I was the only one who remained sitting.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0038.wav,We'll have to watch our chances.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0039.wav,The ship should be in within a week or ten days.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0040.wav,I suppose you wonder why she is coming up here.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0041.wav,Meanwhile I'll go out to breathe a spell.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0042.wav,How could he explain his possession of the sketch.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0043.wav,It seemed nearer to him since he had seen and talked with Gregson.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0044.wav,Her own betrayal of herself was like tonic to Philip.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0045.wav,He moved away as quietly as he had come.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0046.wav,"The girl faced him, her eyes shining with sudden fear."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0047.wav,Close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf-dog.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0048.wav,He looked at the handkerchief more closely.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0049.wav,Gregson was asleep when he re-entered the cabin.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0050.wav,In spite of their absurdity the words affected Philip curiously.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0051.wav,"The lace was of a delicate ivory color, faintly tinted with yellow."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0052.wav,It was a curious coincidence.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0053.wav,Suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0054.wav,There was nothing on the rock.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0055.wav,"Philip stood undecided, his ears strained to catch the slightest sound."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0056.wav,Pearce's little eyes were fixed on him shrewdly.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0057.wav,"I have no idea, replied Philip."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0058.wav,I came for information more out of curiosity than anything else.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0059.wav,His immaculate appearance was gone.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0060.wav,"Anyway, no one saw her like that."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0061.wav,Philip snatched at the letter which Gregson held out to him.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0062.wav,The men stared into each other's face.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0063.wav,"Yes, it was a man who asked, a stranger."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0064.wav,The fourth and fifth days passed without any developments.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0065.wav,They closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0066.wav,He saw Jeanne falter for a moment.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0067.wav,"Surely I will excuse you, she cried."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0068.wav,In a flash Philip followed its direction.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0069.wav,It was his intention to return to Eileen and her father.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0070.wav,He would first hunt up Gregson and begin his work there.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0071.wav,What was the object of your little sensation.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0072.wav,But who was Eileen's double.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0073.wav,"The promoter's eyes were heavy, with little puffy bags under them."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0074.wav,"And now, down there, Eileen was waiting for him."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0075.wav,"There has been a change, she interrupted him."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0076.wav,The gray eyes faltered; the flush deepened.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0077.wav,"It is the fire, partly, she said."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0078.wav,"Then, and at supper, he tried to fathom her."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0079.wav,It was a large canoe.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0080.wav,What if Jeanne failed him.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0081.wav,What if she did not come to the rock.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0082.wav,His face was streaming with blood.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0083.wav,A shadow was creeping over Pierre's eyes.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0084.wav,Scarcely had he uttered the name when Pierre's closing eyes shot open.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0085.wav,A trickle of fresh blood ran over his face.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0086.wav,Death had come with terrible suddenness.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0087.wav,"Philip bent lower, and stared into the face of the dead man."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0088.wav,"He made sure that the magazine was loaded, and resumed his paddling."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0089.wav,The nightglow was treacherous to shoot by.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0090.wav,The singing voice approached rapidly.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0091.wav,His blood grew hot with rage at the thought.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0092.wav,"He went down in midstream, searching the shadows of both shores."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0093.wav,For a full minute he crouched and listened.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0094.wav,He had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0095.wav,A big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0096.wav,Perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0097.wav,Then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0098.wav,Shall I carry you.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0099.wav,A maddening joy pounded in his brain.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0100.wav,"You must sleep, he urged."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0101.wav,"You, you would not keep the truth from me."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0102.wav,He will follow us soon.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0103.wav,But there came no promise from the bow of the canoe.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0104.wav,She was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0105.wav,"Only, it is so wonderful, so almost impossible to believe."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0106.wav,The emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0107.wav,If you only could know how I thank you.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0108.wav,He waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0109.wav,Do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0110.wav,"Much, replied Jeanne, as tersely."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0111.wav,"Instead, he joined her; and they ate like two hungry children."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0112.wav,He was wounded in the arm.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0113.wav,I suppose you picked that lingo up among the Indians.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0114.wav,Her words sent a strange chill through Philip.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0115.wav,He had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0116.wav,Was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0117.wav,"She added, with genuine sympathy in her face and voice."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0118.wav,Pierre obeys me when we are together.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0119.wav,Jeanne was turning the bow shoreward.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0120.wav,My right foot feels like that of a Chinese debutante.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0121.wav,"They ate dinner at the fifth, and rested for two hours."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0122.wav,Two years ago I gave up civilization for this.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0123.wav,She had died from cold and starvation.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0124.wav,It was Jeanne singing softly over beyond the rocks.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0125.wav,He was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0126.wav,Each day she became a more vital part of him.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0127.wav,"It was a temptation, but he resisted it."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0128.wav,This one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0129.wav,Her face was against his breast.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0130.wav,"She was his now, forever."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0131.wav,Providence had delivered him through the maelstrom.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0132.wav,A cry of joy burst from Philip's lips.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0133.wav,Philip began to feel that he had foolishly overestimated his strength.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0134.wav,He obeyed the pressure of her hand.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0135.wav,"I am going to surprise father, and you will go with Pierre."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0136.wav,"About him, everywhere, were the evidences of luxury and of age."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0137.wav,Then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0138.wav,In the picture he saw each moment a greater resemblance to Jeanne.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0139.wav,He told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0140.wav,"Accept a father's blessing, and with it, this."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0141.wav,It seems like a strange pointing of the hand of God.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0142.wav,"Such things had occurred before, he told Philip."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0143.wav,"Ah, I had forgotten, he exclaimed."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0144.wav,But there was something even more startling than this resemblance.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0145.wav,"I have to be careful of them, as they tear very easily."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0146.wav,"Of course, that is uninteresting, she continued."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0147.wav,A moment before he was intoxicated by a joy that was almost madness.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0148.wav,Now these things had been struck dead within him.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0149.wav,For an instant he saw Pierre drawn like a silhouette against the sky.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0150.wav,"Goodbye, Pierre, he shouted."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0151.wav,"And MacDougall was beyond the trail, with three weeks to spare."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0152.wav,Philip thrust himself against it and entered.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0153.wav,MacDougall tapped his forehead suspiciously with a stubby forefinger.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0154.wav,"He was smooth-shaven, and his hair and eyes were black."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0155.wav,"Won't you draw up, gentlemen."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0156.wav,A strange fire burned in his eyes when Thorpe turned.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0157.wav,"He had worshiped her, as Dante might have worshiped Beatrice."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0158.wav,Does that look good.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0159.wav,They look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0160.wav,You want to go over and see his gang throw dirt.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0161.wav,Take away their foreman and they wouldn't be worth their grub.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0162.wav,"That's the sub-foreman, explained Thorpe."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0163.wav,Philip made no effort to follow.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0164.wav,"He came first a year ago, and revealed himself to Jeanne."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0165.wav,They are to attack your camp tomorrow night.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0166.wav,Two days ago Jeanne learned where her father's men were hiding.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0167.wav,"I was near the cabin, and saw you."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0168.wav,Low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0169.wav,Suddenly Jeanne stopped for an instant.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0170.wav,There was none of the joy of meeting in his face.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0171.wav,"And when you come back in a few days, bring Eileen."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0172.wav,Gregson had left the outer door slightly ajar.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0173.wav,The date was nearly eighteen years old.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0174.wav,They were the presage of storm.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0175.wav,Down there the earth was already swelling with life.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0176.wav,For the first time in his life he was yearning for a scrap.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0177.wav,She had been thoroughly and efficiently mauled.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0178.wav,Every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0179.wav,"Tomorrow I'm going after that bear, he said."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0180.wav,"If not, let's say our prayers and go to bed."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0181.wav,"So cheer up, and give us your paw."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0182.wav,This time he did not yap for mercy.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0183.wav,And the air was growing chilly.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0184.wav,"Don't you see, I'm chewing this thing in two."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0185.wav,The questions may have come vaguely in his mind.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0186.wav,Like a flash he launched himself into the feathered mass of the owl.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0187.wav,Ahead of them they saw a glimmer of sunshine.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0188.wav,Two gigantic owls were tearing at the carcass.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0189.wav,"The big-eyed, clucking moose-birds were most annoying."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0190.wav,Next to them the Canada jays were most persistent.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0191.wav,For a time the exciting thrill of his adventure was gone.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0192.wav,He did not rush in.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0193.wav,It was edged with ice.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0194.wav,He drank of the water cautiously.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0195.wav,But a strange thing happened.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0196.wav,He began to follow the footprints of the dog.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0197.wav,"Such a dog the wise driver kills, or turns loose."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0198.wav,Sometimes her dreams were filled with visions.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0199.wav,Thus had the raw wilderness prepared him for this day.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0200.wav,"He leapt again, and the club caught him once more."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0201.wav,"He cried, and swung the club wildly."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0202.wav,"She turned, fearing that Jacques might see what was in her face."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0203.wav,They were following the shore of a lake.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0204.wav,The wolf-dog thrust his gaunt muzzle toward him.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0205.wav,From now on we're pals.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0206.wav,He says he bought him of Jacques Le Beau.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0207.wav,How much was it.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0208.wav,"Youth had come back to her, freed from the yoke of oppression."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0209.wav,"It was not a large lake, and almost round."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0210.wav,Its diameter was not more than two hundred yards.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0211.wav,It drowned all sound that brute agony and death may have made.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0212.wav,"Fresh cases, still able to walk, they clustered about the spokesman."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0213.wav,Between him and the beach was the cane-grass fence of the compound.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0214.wav,"Besides, he was paid one case of tobacco per head."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0215.wav,They die out of spite.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0216.wav,The other felt a sudden wave of irritation rush through him.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0217.wav,"Oppressive as the heat had been, it was now even more oppressive."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0218.wav,The ringing of the big bell aroused him.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0219.wav,At first he puzzled over something untoward he was sure had happened.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0220.wav,A dead man is of no use on a plantation.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0221.wav,I don't know why you're here at all.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0222.wav,What part of the United States is your home.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0223.wav,"My, I'm almost homesick for it already."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0224.wav,"She nodded, and her eyes grew soft and moist."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0225.wav,I was brought up the way most girls in Hawaii are brought up.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0226.wav,That came before my A B C's.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0227.wav,It was the same way with our revolvers and rifles.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0228.wav,But it contributed to the smash.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0229.wav,The last one I knew was an overseer.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0230.wav,Do you know any good land around here.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0231.wav,The Resident Commissioner is away in Australia.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0232.wav,"I cannot follow you, she said."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0233.wav,I never allow what can't be changed to annoy me.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0234.wav,"Why, the average review is more nauseating than cod liver oil."
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0235.wav,His voice was passionately rebellious.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0236.wav,Don't you see I hate you.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0237.wav,So Hughie and I did the managing ourselves.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0238.wav,It happened to him at the Gallina Society in Oakland one afternoon.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0239.wav,He cried in such genuine dismay that she broke into hearty laughter.
data_anikait_16K/arctic_a0240.wav,Wash your hands of me.
